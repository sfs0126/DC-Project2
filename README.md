Pick an Airport Renovation Project Tell me a story about why this project was either a big win (or not) for customers / passengers in the area? Did this significantly change/improve destinations? Direct Flight options? Did this significantly change the delay/cancellation situation by adding capacity? Did this make the airport better able to handle inclement weather? Comparison to national averages might be helpful … Did this airport improve (in some way) relative to other airports? [[It is important to check that the gains seen by people in this area aren't just part of a larger nation-wide trend for more on time arrivals]]\n\n

** Pick an Airport that was renovated \n
** Download data from the BTS website.  (Geography Filter is your friend … there is a TON of data if you tried to download everything) \n
** Do some exploration to understand the situation before after and during the renovation period \n
** Try to quantify where the airport has made significant gains (if at all)\n
